Stop Motion Animation Software

Simple, focused software to help create some stop motion projects for school, mostly for entertainment.

The interesting part of this project for me is to build something from scratch, which will help me create something, from scratch.
Then, once I finish the final product, I will have some record of my work in both Computer Science and 'Theatre', but more broadly 
a rich project in the arts, and showing my capacity for communication. Ultimately though, the thing driving my work on this is that
frankly this has been one of the most enriching and enlightening experiences of my life thus far. It can be so wonderful to work so hard on something so silly and ultimately inconsequential, just to make a funny video or two. It's hard to describe the deep feeling of fullfillment I feel when a whole room of people laughs at something I do. And to know how much work, and joy, and learning I worked through, just to change how they feel a little bit on one day.

The software is very simple, with an intuitive ui that makes it feel playful and easy to manipulate the 'scene'.

A Scene is a grouping of components of several types, most of which take the form of simple images. A scene also contains a set of backgrounds that can be interchanged for the scene. A scene stores all of it's components, and can be used to store the state data of the entire visual picture to allow for pausing in the shooting process. Intuitive keyboard controls and consistent mouse functionality is a big part of my goal, and again I stress that the priority is to make something that feels easy and fun to use, rather than maximally capable.

Those components that are not simple images are a container which can hold a web of relative relationships rather than any particular absolute location like an image. This way, I will hopefully be able to implement any complex structure of images that I want without much difficulty, and can keep them in a familar formation to manipulate multi image characters.
